# Grand Hotel Terminus Email Program

## About project

At my workplace, I was asked if I could make a script for adding mailadresses to an excel spreadsheet.
When I was told the reception at the hotel was using excel to send emails to a list of adresses.
I replied I was interested in making a program capabile to mass send email insted. This project is the result.
